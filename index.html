	<h1>Moving towards renewable energy sources is the only way to go!</h1>
	<img class="center" src="images/SR-Value-D.jpeg" alt="Solar roof and Tesla car image">
	<p class="center">Renewable energy is the way of the future:
	not only are we saving the planet by going
	green, but we're also making the choice that
	makes most sense, in terms of fashion and 
	good sense.</p>
	<p class="center">I have built this website mainly as a basic
	first step in learning web technologies,
	but also to persuade people that renewable
	is not more expensive, and it should be 
	the younger generation's new "standard".</p>

	<p class="center">To put it in simple terms, clean energy
	sources like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy">solar</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power">wind</a> make the most
	sense because of the following reasons:</p>

	<ol class="center">
		<li>They help reduce carbon emissions</li>
		<li>You can save money in the long-term</li>
		<li>They look good af!</li>
	</ol>
